# Exploring the driving under the influence of alcohol dataset

The data used for this notebook represents the percentage of drivers under the influence of alcohol in Serbia, for the years 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. This data was taken from the [open data](https://data.gov.rs/sr/datasets/) provided by Republic of Serbia. The vehicle category is not specified anywhere because all the data refer to drivers of passenger vehicles.

## The aim

Some key insights to gather during the analysis:

- In which police departments is the highest percentage of drivers under the influence of alcohol?
- Is the percentage increasing or decreasing as the time goes?
- Are there some big differences in percentage for different days, different time and different areas?
- Are there any patterns that we can spot?
